    <P style="color: crimson;">My favourite colour is white. It is a calm, delicate and bright colour. The origin of any colour is white. It is the symbol of purity and peace; even our Indian flag has white colour indicating the peace of our nation.White colour is used for identity and this is the reason politicians wear white colour attire which makes them look dignified. Doctors and nurses wear white colour coats which show the calm nature of the colour and angels are also dressed in white which shows their superiority.
