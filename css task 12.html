        <center><p>Forests cover one third of the earth's land mass, performing vital functions and supporting the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people. Forests are home to more than half of the world's land-based species of animals, plants and insects. They also combat climate change and buffer the impacts of storms and floods.</p></center>
