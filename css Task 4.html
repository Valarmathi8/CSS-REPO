    <center><h1>MY FAVOURITE MOVIE</h1></center>
    <P>Today I feel very happy and excited because I am going to share my views on my favourite movie. <br>

        My favourite movie is “pursuit of happyness”. This movie is all about hardwork, dedication, passion, perseverance and never giving up attitude. <br>
        
        In this movie will smith plays a character name Chris gardener, who is living in the last of his means. Chris gardener used to sell bone density scanners and survive. However, after certain point of time, these bone density scanners were outdated and he was unable to sell this scanners.</P>
