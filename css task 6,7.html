    <center><h1>CORRUPTION IN INDIA</h1></center>
    <p>Corruption in India is one of the most menacing threats that our economy has been battling with ever since the independence.At all levels of Indian bureaucracy, corruption has seemingly taken its toll and has been corroding the structure of our nation. 

        Be it private sector or public sector, Indian people have a tendency of misusing the public position in their favor to fulfill their motives and gain personal benefits. <br>
        
        A recent unofficial data published by ‘THE HINDU’ estimated that, Indians had over $1456 billion in Swiss bank. India stands among one of the most corrupt nations in the world.When it comes to fighting this adversary, the first blood must be drawn by general public. If there are no individuals that pay bribe then the structure automatically resurrects again.
        The implementation of laws should be stricter and increased transparency must be brought into action, unless the general public becomes vigilant, corruption cannot be unplugged from our nation.</p>
        <h3>Causes:</h3>
<p>When evaluating the causes responsible for corruption. The number seems to be infinite. However the main reason is lack of implementation of the rules and laws. <br>

    There are numerous laws like Indian penal code and the prevention of corruption act that have been framed to stop corruption but their implementation is missing. <br>
    
    Another prominent reason for corruption is lack of transparency in bureaucracy and governmental processes.
