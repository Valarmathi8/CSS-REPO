    <h2>Using Justify Allignment</h2>
    <p id="just">However, with the changing times and revolutionary technology, travelling has become one of the easiest things to do. There are so many new ways and means to travel that the travel game has changed drastically.

        We can board a variety of vehicles now to travel such as bus, train, truck, aeroplane, submarine, hovercraft, and more. You can reach a place far away within no time thanks to all these transport options.
        
        Further, there are no barriers now. You can use online maps and translators when travelling to a different city or country to help you. Cab service and food service is readily available too. Thus, travelling is very easy now thanks to technology.</p>
