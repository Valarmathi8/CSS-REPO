    <h2>WORD SPACING</h2>
    <p>Corruption in India is one of the most menacing threats that our economy has been battling with ever since the independence.At all levels of Indian bureaucracy, corruption has seemingly taken its toll and has been corroding the structure of our nation.

        Be it private sector or public sector, Indian people have a tendency of misusing the public position in their favor to fulfill their motives and gain personal benefits.
