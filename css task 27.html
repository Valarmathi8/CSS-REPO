        <h2>Global Warming</h2>
        <p>Global warming is increased in earth average surface temperature due to the effect of green house gases, deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. When we burnt fossil fuels such as oil, petroleum and natural gas many chemicals are sent into the atmosphere which will deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <h2>Favourite Color</h2>
        <p>My favourite colour is white. It is a calm, delicate and bright colour. The origin of any colour is white. It is the symbol of purity and peace; even our Indian flag has white colour indicating the peace of our nation.
